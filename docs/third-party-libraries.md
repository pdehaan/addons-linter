# About 3rd Party Libraries in Add-ons

We maintain a list of banned and unadvised third-party JavaScript libraries; these libraries are not allowed/recommended in add-ons (because of security vulnerabilities).

## Banned libraries

### AngularJS `1.x`

AngularJS `1.x` versions before `1.5.3` are not allowed due to a [potential CSP vulnerability](www.slideshare.net/x00mario/an-abusive-relationship-with-angularjs).
